# Jong Toolkit - 종도구상자

this is a collection of scripts to ease the usage of our Joplin markdown editor

## Importer 

Import of notes into joplin from your cloud service

### prerequisite

* Python 3.6 or +
* [joplin terminal](https://joplinapp.org/terminal/) installed
* joplin-api - to request joplin
* beautifulsoup - to get the html page
* pypandoc - to translate the html page to markdown

### installing

* create a virtualenv and activate it

```python 
python3 -m venv jong_toolkit
cd jong_toolkit
source bin/activate
```

* get the source 

```python
git clone https://github.com/foxmask/jong_toolkit
cd jong_toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd jong_toolkit
cp settings.sample settings.ini
```

### settings 

in `the jong_toolkit/settings.ini` file set the following properties
 
```python 
[JOPLIN_CONFIG]
# path to the joplin terminal version
JOPLIN_BIN_PATH = /home/foxmask/.joplin-bin/bin/joplin
# path to the profile of the joplin client (terminal/desktop)
JOPLIN_PROFILE_PATH = /home/foxmask/.config/joplin-desktop
# path to the folder of the cloud storage service
joplin_import_folder = /home/foxmask/Dropbox/Applications/Joplin/letterbox/
# default folder where to import notes
JOPLIN_DEFAULT_FOLDER = Home
JOPLIN_WEBCLIPPER = 41148
JOPLIN_WEBCLIPPER_TOKEN = <put the token from the webclipper config page>
PYPANDOC_MARKDOWN = markdown_github
```

## Importer

script to load JEX or MD files into joplin

### running

you can set a crontab or a "at" service to trigger the command at the given time you want

```python
python jong_toolkit/core.py --importer 
```


## Collector

the script will ease to grab note from note created with only URL as content

This situation occurs when you "share" page link from your phone to Joplin, as joplin does not provide a webclipper on mobile, this will complet this case ;)

### settings 
in the `settings.ini` file, set the `tag` that will be used for checking if notes need to be generated

```
JOPLIN_DEFAULT_TAG = grab
```

### running

you can set a crontab or a "at" service to trigger the command at the given time you want

```python
python jong_toolkit/core.py --collector
```

the note with the shared link
